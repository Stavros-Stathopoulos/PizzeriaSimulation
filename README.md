# Pizzeria Simulation Program
 

## Overview
This Java program is a Pizzeria Simulation that explores three different order management procedures:

PizzaFIFO: Orders are handled using the FIFO algorithm, where the first order taken is the first order served.
PizzaRandom: Orders are processed in a random order.
PizzaProfit: Orders are prioritized based on their price, with the most expensive orders served first.
The goal is to simulate and compare the efficiency of each method in terms of order processing and profit maximization.

## Features
 - Order Placement: Customers can place orders for pizzas with different specifications.
 - Pizza Customization: Users can customize their pizzas by choosing toppings, crust type, and size.
   
## Getting Started
Prerequisites
